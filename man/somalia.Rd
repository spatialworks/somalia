Datasets for Use in Designing Surveys in Somalia
}
\details{
Designing surveys require relevant datasets to be used as basis for
sample size calculations, sampling design, survey planning/logistics and
survey implementation. These include datasets on population, lists of sampling
clusters, map datasets for spatial sampling, and previous survey datasets that
can be used for estimating indicator variance and design effects. This package
contains relevant datasets for use in designing surveys in Somalia.
